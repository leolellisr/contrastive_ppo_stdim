ia368cc-project
==============================

Injecting object-level implicit priors in a PPO agent with contrastive learning algorithm [ST-DIM](https://github.com/mila-iqia/atari-representation-learning). Our PPO code was borrowed from https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl.

Setup
------------

The experiments were ran with PyTorch 1.8.1

``` 
# Create Conda environment for this repo
make create_environment

# Install PyTorch dependencies
pip install torch==1.8.1+cu101 torchvision==0.9.1+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# Install requirements
make requirements
```
